## 📌 Description  
This repository contains my solutions for the **Scientific Computing with Python** course from freeCodeCamp. Each project demonstrates my understanding of Python fundamentals, covering topics such as arithmetic operations, regular expressions, data handling, and algorithmic problem-solving.  

---

## 🔥 What I Learned  
Through these projects, I gained hands-on experience with:  
- ✅ **Python fundamentals** – functions, loops, and conditionals  
- ✅ **Data manipulation** – handling lists, dictionaries, and file operations  
- ✅ **Algorithmic problem-solving** – breaking down complex problems into simple steps  
- ✅ **Testing & debugging** – writing and verifying code with test cases
