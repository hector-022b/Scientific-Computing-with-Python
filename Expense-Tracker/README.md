# Expense Tracker - Budget Management Tool 💰📊  

**Description:**  
This project involves building an expense tracker to manage personal finances efficiently. Using Python and lambda functions, the tracker categorizes expenses, calculates totals, and provides insights into spending habits.  

## 🔥 What I Learned  
Through this project, I gained hands-on experience with:  
- ✅ **Lambda functions** – writing concise, anonymous functions  
- ✅ **Data handling** – working with lists and dictionaries  
- ✅ **Functional programming** – filtering, mapping, and reducing data  

## 🛠 How It Works  
The expense tracker follows these steps:  
1️⃣ Accept user inputs for expense categories and amounts  
2️⃣ Use lambda functions to filter and categorize expenses  
3️⃣ Calculate total spending and category-wise distribution  
4️⃣ Display a summary of financial data  

## 📌 Example Usage
